# Lectures Notes

This is a text version of our Polytech DSP lectures. This `Notes.md` files is structured in a weird way, I know, but I (subjectively) find that easier to read.

The `Notes.md` file uses a mixture of normal markdown syntax and latex equations. It's supposed to be viewed via an app that can handle both (like Typora, Mark Text, etc.).
